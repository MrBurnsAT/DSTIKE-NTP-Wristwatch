On Tindie you can find several ESP based wrist watches and among others the Deauther Watch from DSTIKE. This watch is actually not a watch, but rather a device to scan for WiFi devices, block selected connections, create dozens of networks and confuse WiFi scanners. Spacehuhn developed the software, which contains many interesting functions, but no true time display. One reason for this is the fact that the device does not contain a Real Time Clock (RTC). This means that a time setting is lost each time the unit is restarted. But the device has a WiFi chip, so you can get the time from a time server.
